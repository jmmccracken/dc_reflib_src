Information for pair0077:

Note: X and Y are actually time series with time step 1 day 

Y is the solar radiation in W/m^2 measured in Furtwangen, Black Forest, Germany, by Bernward Janzing.
Each value is the daily average of one day between January 1, 1985 and December 31, 2008.

X is the daily average temperature of the air measured at the same location and the same days.

The data are taken from a larger data set containing solar radiation averages from November 24, 1985 to December 31, 2008
and temperature values from January 1, 1979 to  December 31, 2008.
The original files have been provided by Bernward Janzing and processed by Dominik Janzing to extract the common time interval.

Ground truth Y --> X
