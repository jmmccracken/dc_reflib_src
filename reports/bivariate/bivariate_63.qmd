## Original documentation
```
Information for pair0068:

Timeseries data - Internet connections and traffic at the MPI for Intelligent Systems.

X(t) - bytes sent at minute t.
Y(t) - open http connections during that minute 

Measurements are taken every 20 minutes. 

ground truth:
Y --> X

The data has been generated by Sebastian Stark from the log-files of the http server and processed by Dominik Janzing
