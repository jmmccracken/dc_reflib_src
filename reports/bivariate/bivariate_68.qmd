Gross national income (GNI) and life expectancy. 
One can see the GNI per capita as an index how rich a country is. 
The wealth of a country influences the qualtity of the health care system and thus indirectly the life expectancy of its citizens.

x: GNI (Gross national income) per capita for different countries (in US$)

y: life expectancy at birth for different countries


ground truth:
x --> y

Higher income is expected to increase life expectancy for a variety of reasons. See, e.g., research [here](https://genus.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41118-019-0071-0) and [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0275431) (the literature is full of these types of studies).
