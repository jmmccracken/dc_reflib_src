Information for pair0094:

x = hour of the day
y = temperature in degree celsius

Source:

The data come from a regional energy distributor in Turkey and was obtained from S. Armagan Tarim and Steve Prestwich on June 11 2015.

Common sense tells us that temperature depends on the hour of the day.

Local temperature is strongly related to the time of day (which is itself just a measure of the positional relationship between a point on Earth and the Sun). Here's is an [introduction](https://www.globe.gov/explore-science/scientists-blog/archived-posts/sciblog/2008/02/27/how-the-temperature-varies-during-the-day-and-night/comment-page-1/index.html).
