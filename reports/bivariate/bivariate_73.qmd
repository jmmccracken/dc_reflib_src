Light Response Data

Taken at a flux tower at site DE-Hai
latitude: 51.08?N
longitude: 10.45?E

The filtered version of the data is taken from:

Moffat A.M. (2012) Assessing competing semi-empirical equations:
Light response curve (Chapter 7). In: /A new methodology to interpret
high resolution measurements of net carbon fluxes between terrestrial
ecosystems and the atmosphere/. pp. 68-80. Doctoral thesis, Friedrich

- Response of NEP on PPFDdif

First column (x): NEP (Net Ecosystem Productivity)
- a measure of the carbon flux
- calculated by photosynthetic uptake MINUS release by respiration
- is known to be driven by PPFDdif and PPFDdir
- unit: [?mol/(m?s)]

Second column (y): PPFDdif (Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density, diffusive)
- a measure of light intensity in terms of diffusive photons, that are available for photosynthesis
- i.e. the number of diffusive photons falling on a 1 meter square area per second
- only the photons with a wavelength of 400-700nm (visible light) are available for photosynthesis
- unit [?mol/(m?s)]
PPFD(total) = PPFDdif + PPFDdir

This data is from a PhD dissertation, which is still available [here](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-new-methodology-to-interpret-high-resolution-of-Moffat-Maria/87dfa660a3f6fe5ccb67d012e58c36d94904c7ed) and has a good explanation of the expected causal relationships. See, e.g., Section 1.2.
