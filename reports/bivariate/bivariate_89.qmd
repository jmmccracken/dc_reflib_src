Information for pair0095:

x = hour of the day
y = load: the total electricity consumption in a region of Turkey in "MWh"

Source:

The data come from a regional energy distributor in Turkey and was obtained from S. Armagan Tarim and Steve Prestwich on June 11 2015.

The hour of the day defines what people usually do, if they are sleeping, cooking, watching TV etc. Hence the energy consumption is driven by the hour of the day.

Electricity consumption varies by time of day and year. Here's is an [introduction](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=42915).
