Auto-Mpg Data

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG

1. Sources:
   (a) Origin:  This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is
                maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. The dataset was 
                used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition.
   (c) Date: July 7, 1993

2. Past Usage:
    -  See 2b (above)
    -  Quinlan,R. (1993). Combining Instance-Based and Model-Based Learning.
       In Proceedings on the Tenth International Conference of Machine 
       Learning, 236-243, University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Morgan
       Kaufmann.

3. Relevant Information:

   This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in
   the StatLib library.  In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in
   predicting the attribute "mpg", 8 of the original instances were removed 
   because they had unknown values for the "mpg" attribute.  The original 
   dataset is available in the file "auto-mpg.data-original".

   "The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon,
    to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous
    attributes." (Quinlan, 1993)

Attribute information:

horsepower:       continuous
acceleration:	  continuous

x: horsepower

y: acceleration

ground truth:
x --> y
