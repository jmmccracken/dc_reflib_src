## Original documentation
```
Dataset 'cpus' from the R MASS package. 

According to the description in the documentation of the package 
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MASS/MASS.pdf ):

"A relative performance measure and characteristics of 209 CPUs.

Source:
P. Ein-Dor and J. Feldmesser (1987) 
'Attributes of the performance of central processing units: a relative performance prediction model.'
Comm. ACM. 30, 308â€“317"

We converted the data to a text file by the following R commands:

library('MASS')
write.matrix(cpus,file='/tmp/cpus.txt',sep=',')

X = logarithm of the second column ('syct', cycle time in nanoseconds)
Y = logarithm of the seventh column ('perf', published performance on a benchmark mix relative to an IBM 370/158-3)

We consider syct to be one of the causes of perf.

Ground truth:  X -> Y
```

"Engineered" {{< fa robot >}}

The original data source is still available [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MASS/), [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MASS/MASS.pdf), or [here](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/MASS4/). The original source focused on statistical, not _causal_, analysis. CPU cycle times, however, are often considered the primary driver of performance (see, e.g., [this article](https://performanceengineeringin.wordpress.com/2021/07/24/performance-understanding-cpu-time/)).
