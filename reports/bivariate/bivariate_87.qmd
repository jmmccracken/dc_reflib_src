## Original documentation
```
x = average precipitation over 1948 to 2004 in mm/day
y = average runoff in over 1948 to 2004 mm/day

Precipitation and runoff data over 438 river catchments in the US. We deleted 6 catchments where runoff data had missing values. 
Daily values were downloaded and averaged over the whole available time period (1948-2004).

"MOPEX" data set (http://www.nws.noaa.gov/ohd/mopex/mo_datasets.htm)

Common sense tells us that precipitation is the largest driver of runoff with some confounders such as catchment characteristics.

"Runoff" is defined as precipitation that is not absorbed by the soil; see, e.g., [this introduction to hydrology](https://www.weather.gov/lot/hydrology_education_watercycle).
