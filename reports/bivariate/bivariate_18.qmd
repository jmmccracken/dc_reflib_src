## dc_reflib's notes
::: {.callout-note title="Operational Causality"}
"Physics" {{< fa hand-sparkles >}} 

There is a rich history of predicting geyser eruption times; see, e.g., [the NPS website](https://www.nps.gov/features/yell/ofvec/exhibits/eruption/prediction/predict4.htm).
:::

The original data source is dead, but there is an active database of geyser data that includes this data (and much more): [geyser archive](https://geysertimes.org/archive/).
