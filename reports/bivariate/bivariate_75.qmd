Information for pair0081:

Fluxnet data

The folder contains flux data where fluxes are net CO2 exchanges aggregated
over night, and the temperature accordingly (from http://fluxnet.ornl.gov). 

The site id is BE-Bra
Belgium, Brasschaat

You have 365 values per site (one year).

The night time CO2 is "respiration" the flux from the ecosystem to the
atmosphere but no assumptions on flux partitioning!!! The price is high noise
levels.

x: Temperature in degree Celsius

y: CO2 flux at night

Pleases note that column 3 contains either NaN  if the data were filled,
or 1 for credible values. 


ground truth:
x --> y

The original data source is still available: [Oak Ridge Data Archive](https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dataset_lister.pl?p=9). Local temperatures effects on CO2 flux have been studied a lot of the recent years with respect to climate change. See, e.g., the discussion in [this article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-021-00192-w).
