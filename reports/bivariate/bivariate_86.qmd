## Original documentation
```
x = Organic C content in soil (in g Carbon/kg)
y = Clay content (in g/kg)

Data taken from 150 forest plots. Plots with missing data were excluded.

The clay content in a soil is one determinant of how much carbon can be accumulated in a soil.

Clay content of soil and its biomass are causally related; see, e.g., the original data source and [this review](https://nrcca.cals.cornell.edu/soil/CA2/CA0212.1-3.php).
