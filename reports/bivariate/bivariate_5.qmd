## dc_reflib's notes
The link to the original dataset is working and is an excellent resource:

There is an empirical relationship between age and size of Abalone (see, e.g., the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abalone)). The original source has an excellent discussion and further references.
